# webworldwind-covjson(WIP)

The goal of the project is to be able to eectively visualize environmental data
that is in coverage JSON format. To do this we have decided to use NASA's
WebWorldWind as the base to render the images on.

(Please note: This is still using components not coordinates since all the test files on the ncwms demo use componenets.)

For demo use: https://reading-escience-centre.github.io/webworldwind-covjson/

and to view different files either type in #1, 2, 3 or 4 after the '/' for preset files or the # then your URL. 
URL must be https.
